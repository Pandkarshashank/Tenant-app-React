By having such a system in place, residents can feel more comfortable in reporting their issues, knowing that there is a proper avenue for their concerns to be heard.</div>
        <div className='has-text-right'>Secondly, a complaint system helps to improve communication between residents and management, allowing for more efficient resolution of issues. When residents report their grievances through the complaint system, the management can quickly identify and address the problem, thereby reducing the time taken to resolve the issue. This improved communication can also help to build trust and transparency between the management and the residents.</div>
        <div className='has-text-right'>In conclusion, a complaint system in an apartment complex is crucial for the management to understand the issues faced by residents and take necessary actions to resolve them. By having a complaint system in place, residents can feel more comfortable in reporting their grievances, and the management can quickly address any issues that arise. This system can help to improve communication, build trust, and create a sense of community within the complex. Ultimately, a complaint system can improve the quality of life for residents and enhance their overall living experience.</div>
